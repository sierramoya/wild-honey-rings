<!--<h1><strong>Content Strategy</strong></h1>-->
<!--    <p>My site will be one page and will consist of the following sections on small and large screens:</p>-->

<!--    <p><strong>Logo:</strong> Abigail's Wild Honey Rings and Things logo will be at the top of the site and will continue to follow down as you scroll.-->
<!--        The logo is green, beige, and orange. The entire website background will be beige with hints of green and orange to match the logo.</p>-->

<!--    <p><strong>Welcome:</strong> This is an introduction letting users know the details about the business on the right.-->
<!--        It will also contain a picture of Abigail selling rings on the left side where user eyes will go to first.-->
<!--        The introduction will have a background of a picture of Abigail's ring booth.</p>-->

<!--    <p><strong>Shop:</strong> As you scroll down, four columns and two rows of photos of rings will appear. Also, ring details will appear-->
<!--        such as color, size and price. As you mouse over each picture, it will change to show another view of the specified ring.</p>-->

<!--    <p><strong>Contact:</strong> This section will  be a contact page so users may put their name, email, and reason for messaging. In case someone-->
<!--        is interested in purchasing a ring they may contact Abigail through the website. The background of this section will be a photo of Abigail's-->
<!--        rings behind a green background to match the logo.</p>-->

<!--    <p><strong>Social Media:</strong> The small circles are links to Abigail's social media in case-->
<!--        the user wants to support and follow her to see the process of what she is currently working on.-->
<!--        These circles will be orange.</p>-->
<!--    <h2>Wireframes</h2>-->
<!--        <p>The site will feature one layout shown. I used https://mockflow.com to design the layout of the site.</p>-->
